Mastering time management is not just about doing more work—it's about working smarter and preserving your mental well-being.</p><p>One of the most effective techniques is the Pomodoro technique, which encourages focused work blocks followed by short breaks. Additionally, prioritizing tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix can help you identify what's truly urgent versus what's merely distracting.</p><h3>Practical Tips for Daily Success</h3><p>Use a planner or a digital calendar to map out your week in advance. Account for your most productive hours and schedule your most difficult tasks then. Don't forget to schedule downtime; rest is essential for long-term productivity.</p><p>Consistency is key. Small, daily habits in organization will compound over time, leading to a much more manageable and enjoyable university experience. Remember, time is the only currency you can't earn back.</p>"
